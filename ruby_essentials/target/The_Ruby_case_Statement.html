In this chapter of <a href="/index.php/Ruby_Essentials" title="Ruby Essentials">Ruby Essentials</a> we will look at implementing flow control logic in Ruby scripts through the use of the Ruby <i>case</i> statement.

<p>In the previous chapter we looked at some basic conditional structures using the <i>if ... else</i> and <i>if .. elsif ...</i> mechanisms. These approaches to building conditional logic work well if you need to check a value against only a few different criteria (for example checking the value of a string against a couple of possible candidates):
</p>
<pre>
if customerName == &quot;Fred&quot;
      print &quot;Hello Fred!&quot;
elsif customerName == &quot;John&quot;
      print &quot;Hello John!&quot; 
elsif customername == &quot;Robert&quot;
      print &quot;Hello Bob!&quot;
end
</pre>
<p>This can quickly become cumbersome, however, when a need arises to evaluate a large number of conditions. A much easier way to handle such situations is to use the Ruby <i>case</i> statement, the syntax for which is defined as follows:
</p><p><i>result</i> = case <i>value</i><br />
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Finally, the <i>else</i> statement specifies the default result to be returned if no match is found. 
</p><p>This concept is, perhaps, best explained using an example. The following Ruby case statement is designed to match a particular car model with a manufacturer. Once a match is found, the car and associated manufacturer are included in an output string:
<pre>
car = &quot;Patriot&quot;

manufacturer = case car
   when &quot;Focus&quot; then &quot;Ford&quot;
   when &quot;Navigator&quot; then &quot;Lincoln&quot;
   when &quot;Camry&quot; then &quot;Toyota&quot;
   when &quot;Civic&quot; then &quot;Honda&quot;
   when &quot;Patriot&quot; then &quot;Jeep&quot;
   when &quot;Jetta&quot; then &quot;VW&quot;
   when &quot;Ceyene&quot; then &quot;Porsche&quot;
   when &quot;Outback&quot; then &quot;Subaru&quot;
   when &quot;520i&quot; then &quot;BMW&quot;
   when &quot;Tundra&quot; then &quot;Nissan&quot;
   else &quot;Unknown&quot;
end

puts &quot;The &quot; + car  + &quot; is made by &quot;  + manufacturer
</pre>
<p>When executed, the resulting output will read:
</p>
<pre>
The Patriot is made by Jeep
</pre>
<p>If no match was found in the case statement, then the default result, defined by the <i>else</i> statement would cause the following output to be generated:
</p>
<pre>
The Prius is made by Unknown
</pre>
<a name="Number_Ranges_and_the_case_statement"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Number Ranges and the case statement </span></h2>
<p>The case statement is also particularly useful when used in conjunction with number ranges (for details of ranges read the <a href="/index.php/Ruby_Ranges" title="Ruby Ranges">Ruby Ranges</a> chapter of this book).
</p><p>The following <i>case</i> example detects where a number falls amongst a group of different ranges:
<pre>
score = 70

result = case score
   when 0..40 then &quot;Fail&quot;
   when 41..60 then &quot;Pass&quot;
   when 61..70 then &quot;Pass with Merit&quot;
   when 71..100 then &quot;Pass with Distinction&quot;
   else &quot;Invalid Score&quot;
end

puts result
</pre>
<p>The above code, when executed will result in a "Pass with Merit" message.

<p>The <i>if .. else ...</i> approach to building conditional logic into an application works fine for evaluating a limited number of possible criteria. For much larger evaluations, the Ruby <i>case</i> statement is a less cumbersome alternative. In the chapter we have looked at the case statement and reviewed some examples using strings and number ranges.
